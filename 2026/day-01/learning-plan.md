# 90-Day Cloud & DevOps Learning Plan

## Current Level

I am a **B.Tech Computer Science and Engineering fresher** with hands-on knowledge of:

- Linux fundamentals  
- Networking basics  
- Amazon Web Services (AWS)  
- Git & GitHub for version control  
- Terraform for infrastructure provisioning  
- Frontend technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React  
- Programming languages: C++ and Python  

I shifted my focus to **Cloud and DevOps during my final year**, especially around placement season. While most of my peers were preparing only for traditional software or web development roles, I was still figuring out what genuinely interested me. By the last semester, I finally decided to follow my interest and move toward Cloud, DevOps, infrastructure, and servers, a decision made consciously, not randomly.

## My Understanding of Cloud & DevOps

### Cloud Computing

Cloud is about **creating, managing, and scaling infrastructure** so applications run smoothly without failures. It focuses on:

- Scalability  
- Fault tolerance  
- Disaster recovery  
- High availability and resilience  

The goal is to ensure applications stay reliable even when things break, because things *will* break.

### DevOps

DevOps is not just a collection of tools.

It is a **mindset** that bridges the gap between development and operations to deliver applications smoothly and reliably to end users. Introduced around 2009 by Patrick Debois, DevOps focuses on:

- Automation  
- Observability  
- Reliability  
- Faster and safer software delivery  

The real goal of DevOps is to **build, ship, and operate software without breaking things**, while still moving fast.

## Why I Am Learning Cloud & DevOps (Honestly)

I don’t get excited by standard or repetitive software and web development work that most engineering students follow by default.

When I first heard about Cloud and DevOps, it genuinely sounded different. I started researching it, and my interest kept increasing. To test whether this was real interest or just hype, I watched a full AWS one-shot video and tried to understand what cloud actually is, not just buzzwords.

I liked it.

Coming from a **Tier-3 City**, the tech culture around advanced roles like Cloud, DevOps, Data Scientist, System Admin, or Infra Engineering is very limited. Even in my college, discussions were mostly limited to web development or generic software roles. That lack of exposure made me want to explore deeper and do something different.

Cloud and DevOps felt challenging, practical, and meaningful, so I decided to commit to it seriously.

## Where I Want to Reach (90-Day Outcome)

In the next 90 days, I want to be **confident, not just familiar** with DevOps.

That means:
- Deploying real applications end to end  
- Creating infrastructure instead of clicking around the console  
- Automating workflows  
- Debugging failures in real systems  

Most importantly, I want to understand **how things work internally**, not just how to use tools. I should be able to explain these concepts clearly to others and defend my decisions in interviews.

Avoiding shallow knowledge is a priority.

## Clear Goals for the Next 90 Days

1. **Deploy a production-style web application on AWS**  
   Using Docker, CI/CD pipelines, and Kubernetes.

2. **Build infrastructure using Terraform**  
   Including EC2, VPC, and EKS basics — understanding how real infrastructure and pipelines are designed for different scenarios.

3. **Be interview-ready for entry-level Cloud / DevOps roles**  
   With strong hands-on projects and the confidence to explain what I built and why.

## Core DevOps Skills I Will Build

1. **Linux & Cloud Troubleshooting**  
   Debugging logs, networking issues, permissions, and service failures.

2. **CI/CD Pipelines**  
   Automating build, test, and deployment using modern CI/CD tools.

3. **Containers & Kubernetes**  
   Docker fundamentals, Kubernetes deployments, and debugging real-world issues.

## Weekly Time Budget (Realistic)

- **Weekdays:** 3-4 hours/day (learning + hands-on practice)  
- **Weekends:** 4–6 hours/day (classes, projects, revision)  

**Total:** ~25–30 hours per week

Quality matters more than overloading myself.

## How I’ll Stay Consistent (No Excuses)

- **No zero days** — minimum 30 minutes, even on bad days  
- Track progress through:
  - Habit Tracker  
  - LinkedIn posts  
  - Short personal notes  
- Focus on **doing**, not hoarding tutorials  
- Break things, fix them, and learn from failures  

Consistency beats motivation. Every single time.

## Final Note

This journey is not about perfection or certificates.

It is about building real systems, breaking them, fixing them, and becoming someone who can be trusted with infrastructure and production environments.
