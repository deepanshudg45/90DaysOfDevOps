# Day 30 – Docker Images & Containers

---

# Task 1 – Docker Images

## 1. Pull Required Images

```bash
docker pull nginx
docker pull ubuntu
docker pull alpine
```

## 2. List All Images and Check Sizes

```bash
docker images
```

## 3. Compare Ubuntu vs Alpine

- Ubuntu is a full Linux distribution.
- Alpine is a minimal distribution designed for containers.
- Alpine uses musl libc (smaller footprint).
- Ubuntu includes more libraries and tools.
- Alpine images are significantly smaller.
- Smaller images mean faster downloads and reduced attack surface.

## 4. Inspect an Image

```bash
docker inspect nginx
```

Check:
- Image ID
- Created time
- Architecture
- OS
- Exposed ports
- Default CMD

## 5. Remove an Image

```bash
docker rmi ubuntu
```

Force remove (if required):

```bash
docker rmi -f ubuntu
```

# Task 2 – Image Layers

## 1. View Image History

```bash
docker image history nginx
```

## 2. Observations

- Each line represents one layer.
- RUN commands create filesystem layers.
- ENV, CMD, WORKDIR may show 0B.
- Layers are stacked on top of each other.
- Base image forms the bottom layer.
- Layers are cached during builds.

## 3. Why Docker Uses Layers

- Faster rebuilds using caching
- Shared layers between images
- Efficient storage
- Reduced network transfer
- Easier image version control

1. docker image history nginx
2. Multiple layers listed
3. At least one layer showing size
4. At least one layer showing 0B
5. Layer creation timestamps visible

# Task 3 – Container Lifecycle

## 1. Create Container (Without Starting)

```bash
docker create --name mynginx nginx
docker ps -a
```

## 2. Start Container

```bash
docker start mynginx
docker ps
```

## 3. Pause and Unpause

```bash
docker pause mynginx
docker unpause mynginx
```

## 4. Stop Container

```bash
docker stop mynginx
```

## 5. Restart Container

```bash
docker restart mynginx
```

## 6. Kill and Remove

```bash
docker kill mynginx
docker rm mynginx
```

Key Learnings:
- create ≠ start
- stop = graceful shutdown (SIGTERM)
- kill = force stop (SIGKILL)
- Containers move through states: Created → Running → Paused → Exited
- Containers are ephemeral
- Always verify using docker ps -a

# Task 4 – Working with Running Containers

## 1. Run Nginx in Detached Mode

```bash
docker run -d --name web -p 8080:80 nginx
```

Access:
```
http://localhost:8080
```

## 2. View Logs

```bash
docker logs web
```

## 3. View Real-Time Logs

```bash
docker logs -f web
```

## 4. Exec Into Container

```bash
docker exec -it web /bin/bash
```

If bash not available:

```bash
docker exec -it web /bin/sh
```

## 5. Run Single Command Without Entering

```bash
docker exec web ls /
```

## 6. Inspect Container

```bash
docker inspect web
```

Observe:
- IP Address
- Port Bindings
- Mounts
- Container state
- Network configuration
- Entry point command

# Task 5 – Cleanup

## 1. Stop All Running Containers

```bash
docker stop $(docker ps -q)
```

## 2. Remove All Containers

```bash
docker rm $(docker ps -aq)
```

## 3. Remove Unused Images

```bash
docker image prune
```

## 4. System Cleanup (Use Carefully)

```bash
docker system prune
```

## 5. Check Docker Disk Usage

```bash
docker system df
```

Key Points:
- Always verify before pruning
- Avoid blind cleanup in production
- Monitor disk usage regularly
- Containers should not accumulate
- Build cache can consume space
- Cleanup improves CI performance
